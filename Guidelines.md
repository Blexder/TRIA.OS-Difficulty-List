> **GUIDELINES IN ADDING TRIA MAPS**

Welcome to the official TRIA.os Difficulty List, a map list dedicated 
to listing the hardest recognized maps of TRIA.os. If you are in need
of extra help, you can reach out in our server here:

FORMAT FOR ADDING AN ENTRY:
#.## **Map Name** by Creators [ID] [YouTube Video Link]

EXAMPLE:
6.77 **Kneeling Shore** by Tac_taillike [10148804609/kneeling] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEGJxiDmx6Y]

> **Map Difficulty Rating Classification Sheet**

We will ask many good trust worthy players in tria to rate a maps difficulty from "0-99" [0 = easiest of its difficulty | 99 = hardest] and then we will get the average of them all.

For example say we got (84, 83, 83, 84, 84)

that means our final score for the map would be #.84

then we use the first number naming scheme

>Easy: 1

>Normal: 2

>Hard: 3

>Insane: 4

>Extreme: 5

>Divine: 6

>Eternal: 7

And since the map is a divine it will be 6 which gives us:
6.84

Then the map gets put into a category of

>Bottom: .0 - .19

>Low: .2 - .39

>Middle: .4 - .59

>High: .6 - .79

>Peak: .8 - .99

Since our example map is .84 it would be Peak, this brings our final map classification as
Peak 6.48

> **BOTH LIST GUIDELINES**
1. Maps must not be a buff to an already existing map.
2. No joke maps.
3. The admins have the right to reject your submissions based on varying factors.
4. If a map is currently broken/bugged but still beatable, please label the map as [!] infront of the map name, also **bold** formatted. Do not list a map that is not planning to be fixed.

Example: **[!] Kneeling Shore**

6. If the bug is map breaking (Its impossible to beat the map because of it) label the map as [!!!] infront of the map name, also **bold** formatted. If a map contains [!!!] for 2 months, it will be removed and only readded after a fix.

Example: **[!!!] Kneeling Shore**

7. Reach out to us in the official Discord should you be unsure of a map's worthiness, or if you would like to switch the placement of a map.
8. All maps listed be Divine or harder (aside from Public map list).

Example: `10148804609/kneeling`

4. A YouTube video with the map completion (preferably a good quality one or the best quality you can find) has to be added.


> **List.md GUIDELINES**

The point of this list is to give players a fun enjoyable list of hard maps to play, that have variety, to improve their skill in a orderly fashion.

1. All maps here must be agreed upon quality enjoyable maps (this bar has recently been adjusted to be any map greater than or equal to Eternal Punishment quality after some community merging and so as to avoid potential removals through bias alone)
2.  "If your map has been added to the list for a month or has 3+ victors, it is considered locked in, and any changes to your map for the sole reason of buffing or making the map artificially more difficult puts your map at risk of being blacklisted."
3.  Maps may need an extra victor after verification to gauge if it has met the quality threshold for gameplay.
